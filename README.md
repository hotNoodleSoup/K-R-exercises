# K-R-exercises
I have no programming experience before, so it's not expected someone refer to my code to check correctness of one's code. Just for saving my solution and seeing it in future.

Anyway, I found two repos that were so helpful for me to do exercises.

1. https://github.com/anotherlin/tcpl
    I think this repository conforms C89 well and all the solutions are clear and solid.

2. https://github.com/Heatwave/The-C-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition
    This repository has almost example codes in K&R. You would feel tired if you have to type the whole code in the book manually.
