# K-R-exercises
I have no programming experience before, so it's not expected someone refer to my code to check correctness of one's code. Just for saving my solution and seeing it in future.

Anyway, I found two repos that were so helpful for me to do exercises.

1. https://github.com/anotherlin/tcpl
    This repository follows K&R style well and I think all the solutions are clear and solid so it helped me a lot.

2. https://github.com/Heatwave/The-C-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition
    This repository has mostly all example codes in K&R. You would feel tired if you have to type manually the whole code in the book to solve exercises.
